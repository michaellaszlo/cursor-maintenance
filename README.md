# Maintaining cursor position

The problem of maintaining cursor position across formatting operations
is discussed in an article on my website. This repository implements
several approaches to solving this problem.


## Command-line demonstrations

To run the Python demonstration:

$ python approach_examples.py

The code is compatible with both Python 2 or Python 3.

To run the JavaScript demonstration:

$ d8 approach_examples.js

The Python and JavaScript files implement the same algorithms. They
should return exactly the same result for any given input.
