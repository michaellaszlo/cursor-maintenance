# Maintaining cursor position across formatting operations

This article is for developers who are building text input widgets that
process the user's input to show it in a standard format. If you want to
do real-time formatting and update the text in the input element while
the user is editing it, this article is especially for you.

If you are well acquainted with the problem of maintaining cursor position
and you want to get straight to the code, you can see a live demo and
clone my GitHub repository. The documentation on GitHub tells you how
to use the code. In this article, I analyze the problem and describe
various approaches I explored in the search for a solution.
