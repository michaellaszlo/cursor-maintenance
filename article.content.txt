# Maintaining cursor position across formatting operations

This article is for developers who are building text input widgets that
process the user's input to show it in a standard format. If you want
to do real-time formatting and update the text in the input field while
the user is editing it, this article is especially for you.

If you are well acquainted with the problem of maintaining cursor position
and you want to get straight to my code, you can see a live demo and
clone my GitHub repository. The documentation on GitHub tells you how to
use the code in your own project. In this article, I analyze the problem
and describe various approaches I explored in the search for a solution.


## Here is the problem

Suppose you're coding an input field that requires the user to enter
the population of a city. You want to format this number with commas
separating groups of three digits.

For example, if the user enters `112500`, the input field immediately
changes it to `112,500`.

The user has a cursor in the input field, which we'll represent with
^. Here the cursor is at the right end of the input text:

  112,500^

There are seven characters to the left of the cursor, so we say that
the cursor is at position 7.

We have to update the cursor position after formatting the input. This
is easy to do if we want to keep the cursor at the right end of the
input field.

Suppose the cursor enters a `0`:

  112,5000^

With the newly entered character, the cursor is at position 8. The input
field immediately formats the text `112,5000` to `1,125,000`. Now there
are nine characters, so we move the cursor to position 9:

  1,125,000^

So far, so good. We place the cursor at position `n` when the text
contains `n` characters. The trouble begins when the user moves the
cursor elsewhere in the text.
