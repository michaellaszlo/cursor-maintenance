Concepts

- same-field formatting
  - can be real-time or on-demand
  - mostly write about space: editing and formatting in the same field
  - write one section about timing: does real-time formatting make sense?

- ad hoc approaches
  - anything, mock cursor, meta
  - anything: unstructured calculation
  - mock cursor: a bit of structure
  - meta: more structure

- retrospective approaches
  - Levenshtein, frequency ratios, layer
  - Levenshtein: kludgy and slow
  - frequency ratios: lightweight
  - layer: frequency ratios on semantic layers
